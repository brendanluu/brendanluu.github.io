           I've been busy with finals lately but today I had some free time a decided play with TouchDesigner. This was my first time setting the program up and I used live video from my webcam to do some cool feedback effects. After using TD for a few hours, I can already tell how powerful this program is.

           This week in VR club, we were joined by distinguished alumni Girish Balakrishnan for a live Q & A. Girish recently won an Oscar for his work on The Jungle Book. One thing I related to was when he talked about his time in the accelerated masters program (i'm considering it as well). "The masters program gave me more time to
figure out what I wanted to do, and it gave me a thesis that I could go to a company and say
hey, this is my research, this is what i'm good at."

           Today, I got the chance the check out NeosVR - a multiplayer VR world building engine. The potential for this tool is insane. Building VR apps on a 2D screen and viewing them in an HMD no longer makes any sense. Built in VR for VR - the way it should be.

          Tomorrow, Drexel VR is hosting a Dear Angelica screening. I'm hype for it because I love seeing people's reactions after trying good VR. We'll also be setting up two, possibly three, full VR systems in the same room so that should be interest to pull off. Also my intramural basketball team played well toand won by mercy rule *splash*

          I found a cool VR project on Twitter to- the developers of 'Normal Keyboard' open sourced their project. I downloaded their Unity files and dissected how they made it - its very well thought out. One thing that stood out to me was the way the letters floated above the actual key to create a 3D parallax effect - to me this made the keys look more tangible. Props to <a href="http://www.normalvr.com/">NormalVR</a> for creating a delightful VR interface. I also created a design pattern guide for my 2D UI class.

          Today, I applied to be a student volunteer at SIGGRAPH's 2017 conference. I hope I get accepted because it would be such a great opportunity to represent Drexel at the conference and meet huge players in the VR/AR industry (hoping to land some interviews for my 2018 co-op).

           After the critique in my Animation 2 class, I updated my robot with more detail all around the body. I added fidelity to the camera in the bot's head, put snacks inside it's body, and made the joints better prepared for rigging.

           Today, I revisited another animation I started a month ago. I am trying to export the Maya MASH network to a .fbx file but I'm pretty sure it won't work with the MASH nodes I am using. Tough luck, I even talked to people in Maya's forum about it and no one has an answer.

          I worked with my bro Tyler Roach to get networking done for my vr dancefl00r. This means we connected an Oculus Rift and HTC Vive together over a server so that two people could be in the same vr r00m. We used Photon Networking with Unity and it worked! There are definitly bugs we have to iron out (lag and scaling issues). Our next objective is to add voicechat.

           Tonight I went to my first 76er's game with Robin, Nando, Aslan and Aaron. They won on a buzzer beater (‾⌣‾)

           My first scripting and art history classes were today. I have good teachers, they seem very passionate about helping their students LEARN swag. I'm very happy to be a student at Drexel. Everything feels right -- classes, friends, Philly -- all good. Drexel's attitude toward innovation is proper. Keep grinding dude

           For my presentation with Urban Outfitters' CEO (Dick Hayne) next week, my advisor Nick Jushchyshyn tasked me with modelling a photoreal version of Main Building's gallery. He provided reference photos for me that I threw at Agisoft's Photoscan photogrammetry software. At first, the results were abysmal. After learning more about the program, I was able to remove/mask photos that aren't ideal for photogrammetry. My final result is above^

  ToI met with the Child Life Staff at St. Chris and learned more about their efforts to bring VR to children undergoing burn dressing changes - similar to the research with <a href="https://www.hitl.washington.edu/projects/vrpain/">SnowWorld VR</a>. They want to adapt my Superhero Flight game to an experience that a child can wear for 10-20 min while their burns are being tended to. Their team is working on a proposal with Drexel's IRB so we can bring this to real patients. I'm excited to move forward with their research team.

           This weekend I prepared my Superhero flight VR experience for St. Christopher's Children's Hospital. I configured an Android development environment on my computer and built the game to my phone.
         </p>

         <p>
           I'm meeting with their research team tomorrow to discuss ways we can adapt the game to fit their research. I'm excited the start classes this week. My classes should be fun👌

           I finished all the domesticated things I had to do around my apt, balled, and worked on a FB cover photo for DUVR's first winter term meeting. The premise of the meeting is 'How to Get Involved.' I'll most likely revisit the graphic to make it better.

           After shooting a series of 360 photos around URBN Center, I worked on a simple VR scene transition where a person can go inside a photosphere.
         </p>

         <p>
           I'm proud of how it turned out because I got to explore the super useful <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64131"> VR Toolkit</a> and used a clever technique to render the photosphere texture (reversing the normals of the sphere in Maya and applying the photo texture to the inside).
         </p>

         <p>
           I also learned about and began using <a href="https://unity3d.com/services/collaborate">Unity Collaborate</a>, "a simple way for small teams to save, share, and sync their Unity project. It’s cloud hosted and easy to use so the entire team can contribute to the Project, regardless of location or role." Perfect for version control and working between computers. HYPE!

           Today, I got to try <a href="http://zspace.com/"> zSpace</a> during a meeting they had at Drexel. Their AR learn experience seems a bit behind Microsoft's Holographic technology but I liked the fact that they focused on creating a shared learning experience. Immersive content is significatly better when experienced with other people.
         </p>

         <p>
           I also decided to scrap the Rhino file that I was trying to export to Maya because the area of the URBN Center that it was created for has very complex detail looking upwards. I'm going to use the main lobby instead.
         </p>

         <p>
           I'm beginning to realize all of the things I don't know about 3D animation and game development. EveryI learn more.

           I'm attempting to create an architectural walk through of Drexel's URBN Center. My friend from Drexel's architecture program gave me a Rhino file of part of the building that she created so I spent time figuring out how I'm going to export the model to bring into Unity.
         </p>

         <p>
           I decided that the best plan is to export it to Maya and texture it so that I can add VR walkthrough functionality in Unity. I plan to do the texturing tomorrow. No easy task. I hope I can do it.

           There's a research team at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children that wants to adapt my <a href="http://brendanluu.com/fly-like-superman-vr-experience/"> SupermanVR</a> experience to help them move forward with a study on virtual reality usage during burn dressing changes. The idea is that VR will distract the patient from pain and the snowy environment will make them feel cooler.
         </p>

         <p>
           Today, I updated my project to Unity 5.5, created a snowy particle system and changed the environment to a low-poly winter environment I found in the Asset Store.
         </p>

         <p>
           I'm going to demo my app to the research team sometime this month.

            Starting this year, I'm publishing an activity sheet to share daily life progress. Each activity will be accompanied by a photo or video.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, along with starting my activity sheet, I share a project I've recently started inspired by my love of music, dancing, and going out. The goal of this is to create a social VR dance club.
          </p>

          <p>
           So far I have a Unity scene with body tracking IK and spatial audio speakers. Fun!
