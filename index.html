         As I woke from my sleep deprived slumber, I picked up the book 'How We Learn' as per recommendation from my friend Zack. Going through the beginning of the book, one thing stood out to me. The author, Benedict Carey, explains that quite possibly, my ad-hoc, jumbled approach to learning in college may be helping me after all. The book is intriguing thus far.

         So I pulled an all-nighter today procrastinating/working on my UI design homework. My assignment is to redesign a news website - I choose <a href="http://www.highsnobiety.com/">Highsnobiety</a>. Some wireframes I created are above.
       </p>

       <p>
         Dick Hayne briefly stopped by the MoCap Lab to visit a small number of VR club members. The visit lasted less than two minutes but he was 100% impressed by our groups drive and ambition. I need to sleep zzz

       <p>
         This weekend I prepared for Dick Hayne's visit to the digital media dept. A few other students are going to be there when he visits and I worked with them to get their demo vr applications ready. Updates on how the meeting goes tomorrow.
              </p>

       <p>
         I also worked on a model sheet for my character animation class, ball'd a lot, and partied with my boy Sean Bailey. Good weekend / week to come!

       <p>
         Today, Sean Bailey and I Skyped with serial entreprenuer Julie LeMoine. She has been creating immersive training content for the past 30 years and she gave us insight about how VR/AR can be used outside of entertainment. We are going to use her as a source in our talk on 'VR in education' that we'll be presenting at Drexel Nerd Night.
       </p>

       <p>
         I also worked with Nick J to refine our presentation for Dick Hayne. Time to enjoy the weekend.

         The first VR club of the term was tonight, we had a lot of nice faces show up. ---- I spent a few hours moving chairs and shooting my own photogrammetry photos in the AJ Drexel Gallery.

         My first scripting and art history classes were today. I have good teachers, they seem very passionate about helping their students LEARN swag. I'm very happy to be a student at Drexel. Everything feels right -- classes, friends, Philly -- all good. Drexel's attitude toward innovation is proper. Keep grinding dude

         For my presentation with Urban Outfitters' CEO (Dick Hayne) next week, my advisor Nick Jushchyshyn tasked me with modelling a photoreal version of Main Building's gallery. He provided reference photos for me that I threw at Agisoft's Photoscan photogrammetry software. At first, the results were abysmal. After learning more about the program, I was able to remove/mask photos that aren't ideal for photogrammetry. My final result is above^

Today I met with the Child Life Staff at St. Chris and learned more about their efforts to bring VR to children undergoing burn dressing changes - similar to the research with <a href="https://www.hitl.washington.edu/projects/vrpain/">SnowWorld VR</a>. They want to adapt my Superhero Flight game to an experience that a child can wear for 10-20 min while their burns are being tended to. Their team is working on a proposal with Drexel's IRB so we can bring this to real patients. I'm excited to move forward with their research team.

         This weekend I prepared my Superhero flight VR experience for St. Christopher's Children's Hospital. I configured an Android development environment on my computer and built the game to my phone.
       </p>

       <p>
         I'm meeting with their research team tomorrow to discuss ways we can adapt the game to fit their research. I'm excited the start classes this week. My classes should be funðŸ‘Œ

         I finished all the domesticated things I had to do around my apt, balled, and worked on a FB cover photo for DUVR's first winter term meeting. The premise of the meeting is 'How to Get Involved.' I'll most likely revisit the graphic to make it better.

       <p>
         After shooting a series of 360 photos around URBN Center, I worked on a simple VR scene transition where a person can go inside a photosphere.
       </p>

       <p>
         I'm proud of how it turned out because I got to explore the super useful <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64131"> VR Toolkit</a> and used a clever technique to render the photosphere texture (reversing the normals of the sphere in Maya and applying the photo texture to the inside).
       </p>

       <p>
         I also learned about and began using <a href="https://unity3d.com/services/collaborate">Unity Collaborate</a>, "a simple way for small teams to save, share, and sync their Unity project. Itâ€™s cloud hosted and easy to use so the entire team can contribute to the Project, regardless of location or role." Perfect for version control and working between computers. HYPE!

       <p>
         Today, I got to try <a href="http://zspace.com/"> zSpace</a> during a meeting they had at Drexel. Their AR learn experience seems a bit behind Microsoft's Holographic technology but I liked the fact that they focused on creating a shared learning experience. Immersive content is significatly better when experienced with other people.
       </p>

       <p>
         I also decided to scrap the Rhino file that I was trying to export to Maya because the area of the URBN Center that it was created for has very complex detail looking upwards. I'm going to use the main lobby instead.
       </p>

       <p>
         I'm beginning to realize all of the things I don't know about 3D animation and game development. Everyday I learn more.

       <p>
         I'm attempting to create an architectural walk through of Drexel's URBN Center. My friend from Drexel's architecture program gave me a Rhino file of part of the building that she created so I spent time figuring out how I'm going to export the model to bring into Unity.
       </p>

       <p>
         I decided that the best plan is to export it to Maya and texture it so that I can add VR walkthrough functionality in Unity. I plan to do the texturing tomorrow. No easy task. I hope I can do it.

         There's a research team at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children that wants to adapt my <a href="http://brendanluu.com/fly-like-superman-vr-experience/"> SupermanVR</a> experience to help them move forward with a study on virtual reality usage during burn dressing changes. The idea is that VR will distract the patient from pain and the snowy environment will make them feel cooler.
       </p>

       <p>
         Today, I updated my project to Unity 5.5, created a snowy particle system and changed the environment to a low-poly winter environment I found in the Asset Store.
       </p>

       <p>
         I'm going to demo my app to the research team sometime this month.

          Starting this year, I'm publishing an activity sheet to share daily life progress. Each activity will be accompanied by a photo or video.

        <p>
          Today, along with starting my activity sheet, I share a project I've recently started inspired by my love of music, dancing, and going out. The goal of this is to create a social VR dance club.

        <p>
         So far I have a Unity scene with body tracking IK and spatial audio speakers. Fun!
